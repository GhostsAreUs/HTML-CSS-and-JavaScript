				<p>Gen X’ers (55%) and Millennials (52%) are the most likely to believe in ghosts, followed closely by Gen Z (49%), while only one in three Boomers (33%) say they believe. Looking across the country, Albertans are the most likely to believe in the supernatural: nearly six in ten (57%) say they believe in ghosts, placing them well ahead of BC (39%) and Ontario (42%).

				<h2 id="paragraph-three">Paragraph Three</h2>
				<p>Could a desire to connect with lost loved ones be fuelling belief in supernatural spirits? The survey finds that many Canadians have taken matters into their own hands by actively trying to contact the dead. At some point, nearly half (45%) have used a Ouija board (32%), consulted a psychic (20%) or a medium (11%), or participated in a séance (4%). Among those who believe in ghosts, six in ten (60%) have tried at least one of these methods of connecting to someone from beyond the grave, with Ouija boards (40%) and psychics (30%) being the most popular.</p>
